# Pet Service Management System

## Overview

### Introduction

Pet owners in our community currently spend an average of 60 minutes per day visiting pet stores to select, purchase, and receive grooming and spa services, pet hotel services, and other pet-related products. About 25 minutes of this time is spent commuting to and from the pet store, selecting their items or services, and paying by cash or with credit card. When pet owners go out for these services, they spend an average of 80 minutes off-site. Some pet owners call the pet store in advance to order a service to be ready for them to pick up. Pet owners donâ€™t always get the selections they want because the store runs out of certain items. The pet store wastes a significant quantity of items that are not purchased and must be thrown away. These same issues apply to all pet services, although far fewer pet owners use the store for these services than for purchasing items.

To address these issues, we propose the development of a Pet Service Management System. This software will introduce a home page that introduces the pet store, grooming and spa services, pet hotel services, pet food, pet toy categories, frequently asked questions, pet clothing, promotional services, and best-selling products. This software aims to streamline the pet service process, reduce time, and improve the overall customer experience. It will also help the pet store to better manage its inventory and services, leading to increased efficiency and profitability.
